Text Classifier
===============

Given a set of positive and negative training example documents, this program
builds a model that can then be used to predict the class of other documents.

# Example Usage

Let's teach a model to distinguish between `.h` and `.cc` files:

    $ find base/ -name \*.cc |
      xargs text-classifier --strategy=plain learn training-data 0
    $ find base/ -name \*.h |
      xargs text-classifier --strategy=plain learn training-data 1
    $ text-classifier --cost-function=f1 --weight=bns --no-normalize \
      analyze training-data model

Now let's use the model:

    $ find tools/text-classifier -name \*.cc -or -name \*.h |
      xargs text-classifier --no-normalize classify model |
      sort -k2 -g | column -t
    tools/text-classifier/23andme.cc          -0.0794910192
    tools/text-classifier/html-tokenizer.cc   -0.0824450776
    tools/text-classifier/text-classifier.cc  -0.0853220075
    tools/text-classifier/23andme.h           0.308668882
    tools/text-classifier/html-tokenizer.h    0.272325069
    tools/text-classifier/utf8.h              0.298772722
