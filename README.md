Text Classifier
===============

Given a set of positive and negative training example documents, this program
builds a model that can then be used to predict the class of other documents.

# Example Usage

Let's teach a model to distinguish between `.h` and `.c` files:

    $ find base/ -name \*.cc |
      xargs text-classifier --strategy=plain learn training-data 0
    $ find base/ -name \*.h |
      xargs text-classifier --strategy=plain learn training-data 1
    $ text-classifier --weight=bns analyze training-data model

Now let's use the model:

    $ find tools/text-classifier -name \*.cc -or -name \*.h |
      xargs text-classifier classify model |
      sort -k2 -g
